![MX Project Banner](https://drive.google.com/file/d/145asqGYFPEgcQ1CCixcuD0Il4-THKsgh/view?usp=sharing)

A high-performance, standalone traffic-weaving script designed for high-speed "No Hesi" style gameplay.

## 🚀 Features
* **Brand Identity:** Official MX Project HUD.
* **Smart UI:** HUD automatically hides when you exit the vehicle or switch seats.
* **Instant Reset:** Scores, combos, and multipliers wipe immediately upon collision or sudden speed loss.
* **Anti-Farm Logic:** You can only score once per vehicle until you move at least 50 meters away.
* **Optimized:** Runs at 0.00ms when idle; low latency polling only while driving.

2. Rename the folder to `mx-cutting-up`.
3. Add `ensure mx-cutting-up` to your `server.cfg`.
4. In-game, use the command `/nohesi` while in the driver's seat to begin.
